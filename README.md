## 🖼️ Logo Setup

To use a custom logo:
1. Place your image in the same folder as `index.html` (e.g., `logo.png`)
2. Replace this in the HTML:
   ```html
   <div class="logo">
     <img src="logo.png" alt="Cybersecurity Roadmap Logo">
   </div>
   ```
3. CSS already handles circular styling and resizing.
